# Assignment Repository - CloudVandana_Assignment_2023

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming assignments in Java, JavaScript, and HTML. Each folder within this repository corresponds to a different programming language and includes explanations and code for specific tasks. Below, you will find a brief overview of each assignment along with the structure of the repository.

## Repository Structure

### JAVA
- **Shuffle Array**: Create an array with values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and shuffle it.
- **Roman to Integer**: Accept a Roman numeral as input and convert it to an integer (e.g., IX to 9).
- **Pangram Checker**: Check if the input is a pangram, which is a sentence containing all the alphabets from A to Z.

### JavaScript
- **Reverse Sentence**: Take a sentence as input and reverse every word in that sentence (e.g., "This is a sunny day" becomes "shiT si a ynnus yad").
- **Sort Array in Descending Order**: Perform sorting of an array in descending order.

### HTML
- **Basic Calculator**: Create a basic calculator with the functionality of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Survey Form**: Build a survey form with fields for First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Country (dropdown), Gender (checkbox), Profession, email, and mobile number. All input fields are required for form submission. Two buttons, "Submit" and "Reset," are included. The "Reset" button resets the form, while clicking "Submit" checks all fields for necessary validations. After validation, a popup appears displaying selected values with labels.
